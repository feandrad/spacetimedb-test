1. Remove unnecessary or redundant comments (such as comments that just restate what the code does, or outdated notes).
2. Apply clean code principles throughout the project. Here’s what that means:

- Meaningful Naming: Variables, functions, and classes should have descriptive names that reveal their intent.
- Short, Focused Functions: Break large or complex functions into smaller ones with a single responsibility.
- Consistent Formatting: Follow a consistent coding style, including indentation, brace placement, and spacing.
- Avoid Magic Numbers/Strings: Replace them with named constants where possible.
- Minimize Comments: Prefer self-explanatory code over comments. Only keep comments that explain "why", not "what".
- Remove Dead Code: Delete commented-out blocks and unused variables or imports.
- Error Handling: Ensure exceptions are caught meaningfully, and logging (if used) is clean and consistent.
- Avoid Deep Nesting: Refactor code to reduce nesting, using early returns when appropriate.
- Follow DRY Principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself — extract repeated logic into helper functions or constants.
- Code Readability Over Cleverness: Prefer simple, understandable code rather than overly optimized or obscure tricks.
